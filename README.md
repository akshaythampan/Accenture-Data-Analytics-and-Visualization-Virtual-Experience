# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Experience

## Task - 1
### Project Understanding:
A data analyst sits between the business and the data.

One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz. She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project. Mae has scheduled a project kick-off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.

### About Client: [Social Buzz](https://github.com/akshaythampan/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Experience/blob/main/Social%20Buzz%20Brief.pdf).
Social Buzz has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.

### Task for Accenture:
The client has tasked Accenture with the following three requirements:
1. Audit of big data practice.
2. Recommendations for IPO.
3. Analysis of popular content.

### Accenture Project Team:
![team](https://github.com/akshaythampan/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Experience/assets/130158662/01f9c963-8fad-4cde-b26b-ebd95c4afd7e)


### Task for Data Analyst:
Analysis of sample datasets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories. The client wants to see "An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity."

## Task - 2
Often, you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for. So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

After the analysis, we have identified the data sets needed to complete the analysis:
1. Reaction Score (score is used to quantify popularity)
2. Content ID
3. Reaction Types
4. Content type
5. Category

### Data Cleaning:
Clean the data by:
- Removing rows that have missing values.
- Changing the data type of some values within a column.
- Removing columns that are not relevant to this task.

Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

End result will be a cleaned datasets:

1. Cleaned Reaction Types
2. Cleaned Reactions
3. Cleaned Content

### Data Modelling:
Create a final dataset by merging the three tables.

End result will be one spreadsheet:

- Merged and cleaned dataset: [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/akshaythampan/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Experience/blob/main/Cleaned%20Dataset%20-%20Sheet1.csv)

## Task - 3
### Data Visualization and Storytelling:

## Task - 4
### Present to the Client:
Present your PowerPoint presentation to the client and deliver the insights of your analysis.
